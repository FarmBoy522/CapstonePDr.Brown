20230912-
	-Meet with assigned group for first time 
	-Read over project details begin to think about what part i want to tackle
	-We made a github
20230914-
	-Worked on Organizing Github
	-Michael emailed Brown about project
	-Created Discord group
	-Michael chosen as Scrum Leader
20230919-
	-Met with Dr. Brown to see what they already have
	-chose area of focus for each member (code for me)
	-Preliminary Parts list
20230921-
	-Began researching ways to take in raw data and make it usable
	-Maybe could just be microcomputer 
20230926-
	- Meeting on friday with Dr. Brown
	- Continuing to research ways to convert raw data to usable form
	- Straying away from Microcomputer to ADC system instead
20230928-
	-Starting to compile information for sprint 1 presentation
	-Read fourms with other people who have attempted to do similar projects
	 using ADC - not looking great
	-Looking at commercial products designed for specifically what i need they're
	 all very expensive.
20231003-
	-looked over project documents added anything i needed to add for code
	-Tried to obtain file of raw data to see what im working with but the 
	 system they currently use pre formats the data so its pretty useless
20231005-
	Sprint 1 Presentation
20231010-
	-Career Fair
20231012-
	-Continue to research easiest way to accomplish purpose of device
	-examine electrical system schematic to see what needs to be implimented in 
	 addition to ADC seems pretty straightforward
20231017-
	-Went over test plan with everyone
	-Explained the issue with collecting raw data and trying to format it
20231019-
	-Explained how i thought essentially creating an osciloscope from nothing 
	 was going to be a essentially impossible task for me to accomplish to TA 
	 he agreed
20231024-
	-Talked to Dr.Brown about the possibility of using his osciloscope for project
	 he was fine with that
20231026- 
	-Discussed with group new direction for software side of things discussed
	 ways to run osciloscope in PUD maybe a small computer running windows would
	 work
20231031-
	-Worked on Sprint 2 presentation etc.
20231102-
	-Sprint 2 demo
20231107-
	- Started messing around with picoscope software
	- Settings file Dr.Brown provided doesnt seem to be working
	- Also picoscope doesnt record data correctly 
20231109-
	-Figured out i was using a newer version of picoscope software downloaded
	 older version still isnt recording data correctly
20231114-
	-Got picoscope to record correctly by manually setting my own settings
	 will have to see if these settings work for actual testing but for now its 
	 fine for just messing around with
20231116-
	-started messing around with python code to run picoscope automatically
	 some success but i need to see how it runs on actual unit that will be in box
	 exception handling may be an issue
20231121-
	-Not in class
20231128-
	-Continued to mess around with scripts 
20231130-
	-started messing around with pi pico to see how i can impliment different
	 light scripts. Pretty straight forward low power might be a challenge due
	 to pico only accepting up to 3.3V
20231205-
	writing code for pico to demonstrate some basic functionality
